UC Davis Dr. Sheela Toprani Lab, Epilepsy

Contains MATLAB tasks as well as scripts used to create parameter files for BCI2000 software. STRADA contains a MATALB app that seeks to implement native and BCI2000 cognitive tasks with an easy to use interface (still in development).
Some of the tasks here include:
- Emotional Recognition Tasks (ERT) --> Tests emotional processing/cognition
- Verbal Digit Span --> Verbally test short-term and working memory while avoiding practice effects.
- Stroop --> Measure selective attention capacity and skills, processing speed, and executive processing
abilities
- Too Many Words --> Verbal short-term memory, motor and cognition.

This clinical research is conducted in human patients with medically intractable epilepsy undergoing short-term inpatient video-EEG monitoring with intracranial electrodes as part of standard pre-surgical evaluation.
